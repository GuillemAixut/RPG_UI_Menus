## What is a UI/HUD?

The user interface or UI (User Interface) is a concept that encompasses information architecture, patterns and different visual elements.

Provide clear, precise and direct and indirect information to the player so that he can enjoy the game to the fullest.

# Differences between UI and HUD
## UI

The expression UI comes from Interface of User, which stands for User Interface. The idea of ​​the UI is to guide the user through and provide them with information that they can interact with while leaving out the main action of the game.

An example of this are the Menus, for example the options, an inventory or even the purchase menu of a store.

## HUD

The HUD or Head-up display is the interface that is responsible for displaying relevant information for the player while he is playing the game without such information distracting the player from playing the game.

Some common examples are the life or number of lives, the energy or mana that the character has or the attacks/weapons that we have equipped

# Types of UI/HUD

## Diegetic

The old reliable, all those elements that exist about the game.
Like time, points, damage, etc.

## Not Diegetic

Objects that exist in the game space and seek to be immersive.
For example, a helmet with its own interface or a watch, etc.
	
The Dead Space helmet is a clear example since it has life integrated into the model

## Space

They are those objects that are part of the game scenario but not of the story, that is,  
the character is not aware that they exist.

For example, wings of light that indicate where there are things.

## Meta

Similar to non-diegetic but more abstract.

Elements that, although they do not exist in the universe of the character, seek to be immersive and that the player "feels" the same as the character.

A clear example is the blood stains around the screen when your character is damaged.

# Theory of color

When developing a UI we have to take into account the color palettes and the meaning established within the video game community that these have.

For example, the color red is usually associated with the life or lives that the player has, on the other hand, blue is usually associated with Mana and even yellow/green in some cases is associated with the energy/stamina bar.

# User Experience 

An interface must be clean and tidy to convey information accurately to prevent the player from making mistakes during their interaction.

The following examples are classified only
taking into account my criteria and nothing else,
therefore you may not feel
fully identified or disagree with my
personal opinion.

Must be: Clear, Concise, Coherent, Flexible and Visually Appealing

## Good examples

![github 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99950345/223749341-e8aae75a-6e59-492f-b90e-85e2229e66ea.png)

**_Undertale_** is the clear example of a simple and neat user interface

![github 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99950345/223749625-7196d81d-5c73-4f03-9f95-f1733449d0a7.png)

Despite having a user interface with a lot of information that goes unnoticed and does not bother the player, that is why **_Darkest Dungeon_** is a great example of order and distribution.

## Bad examples

![github 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99950345/223749842-55d93726-3184-427a-8f8a-f3776d360b28.png)

Although **_World of Warcraft_**'s user interface is usually quite clean and simple, some external applications can modify it to the point of filling the information screen almost completely.

![github 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99950345/223750124-996ae5f3-efe2-4b8d-af8f-86126c09727f.png)

Despite being a great game and one of my favorites, **_Persona 5_** makes it clear to us that more is not equal to better, since despite having a super cool and well-worked UI, it takes away from the rest of the game and in some cases it gets annoying or look weird.
