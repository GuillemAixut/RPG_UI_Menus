##Differences between UI and HUD
### UI

The expression UI comes from Interface of User, which stands for User Interface. The idea of ​​the UI is to guide the user through and provide them with information that they can interact with while leaving out the main action of the game.

An example of this are the Menus, for example the options, an inventory or even the purchase menu of a store.

### HUD

The HUD or Head-up display is the interface that is responsible for displaying relevant information for the player while he is playing the game without such information distracting the player from playing the game.

Some common examples are the life or number of lives, the energy or mana that the character has or the attacks/weapons that we have equipped

Guerrilla War, released in Japan as Guevara (ゲバラ), is an overhead run and gun game produced by SNK. Originally released for arcades in 1987 as a coin-operated arcade game, Guerrilla War was later ported to Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Commodore 64, NES, PlayStation Network, and ZX Spectrum.

Guerrilla War followed the adventures of two unnamed rebel commandos (Che Guevara and Fidel Castro in the Japanese version) as they raid an unnamed Caribbean Island in order to free it from the rule of an unnamed tyrannical dictator. Along the way the players vanquish hordes of enemy soldiers while attempting to rescue hostages (with large score reductions for any hostages killed in the crossfire), collecting weapons from troopers and operating tanks.
